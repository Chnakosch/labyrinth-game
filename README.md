# labyrinth-game
It's a simple ASCII game with a randomly generated maze that you have to navigate through.

I made it a long time ago in high school and it holds a special place in my heart, so I thought it would be cool to publish it.

When I made it I didn't really now any maths or theory related to generating random maps, yet I still managed to make a fully random (always solvable) maze generator using only my own ideas. The solution is not the most elegant but I haven't used Pascal since then so I can't really be bothered to change it.
